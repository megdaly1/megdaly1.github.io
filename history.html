    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
      Cleves and Loneman Jewelers has been open since 1932 and was opened by Ed
      Cleves Sr. and Joe Lonnneman. They opened the store after being fired from
      Motch Jewelers during the Depression. When the two men retired it was then
      passed down to Ed Cleves Jr. and his wife Gertrude. Lonneman was no longer
      apart of the buisness but they kept the name to honnor the hardwork of
      both men. Charlie and Mary Lynn took over ownership of the store in 1989
      upon Nick's retirement. Gert continued working at the store until 1997. He
      began working at the store full time in 2004. He and Erin were married in
      2005. They then took ownership of the store January 1st 2017. Charlie and
      Mary Lynn are easing their way into retirement and are still working at
      the store part time.
